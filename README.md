`QLThumbnail` is a SwiftUI view that asynchronously loads a thumbnail for a file at a given URL. It uses the [`QuickLook`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicklook) and [`QuickLookThumbnailing`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicklookthumbnailing) frameworks to make this possible.
